# YAWMA

## You Workload: Simplied

YAWMA (Yet Another Workload Management App) is a simple workload management tool built in the Wails framework to keep all my projects and priorities straight.

## Background

YAWMA was the first large scale app I ever made, but I never got around to finishing it, so I thought that I might as well do so.

Basically, I have a messy desktop, full of folders, projects, responsibilities, and half baked ideas. So I wanted a simple app to manage them all. And while I found a couple good choices, nothing really hit me as something I could get used to, so I set out on making my own.
